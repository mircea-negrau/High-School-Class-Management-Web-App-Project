# High School Project for receiving Programming Diploma
## Overview
- Programming language: C#, CSS (ASP.NET Web Application .NET Framework); 
- Libraries: Bootstrap, datatables, fontawesome;
- Database: Microsoft SQL;
- Deadline: 4 weeks;
- *No previous knowledge of either C# or databases*

## Short Description
- This application is an improved variant of [my WinFormsApp School Management Project](https://github.com/mircea-negrau/High-School-Class-Management-Project), as all the elements shown in the application are programatically generated instead of being hard-coded;
- The database was set up so that multiple teachers could connect to the program remotely;
- The application aims to function as a school gradebook, the teacher having the opportunity to grade students and add or motivate their absences;
- Also, teachers can change details (add / delete grades / absences) only to the classrooms they teach and only to the subjects they teach to that subject (unless this is the assigned teacher of the class - thus having access to motivate absences to any student). 
- This version aims, moreover, to provide the opportunity for students (and their parents) to strictly access their own information (grades, absences, classroom);
