# High School Project for receiving Programming Diploma
## Overview
- Programming language: C#, CSS (ASP.NET Web Application .NET Framework); 
- Libraries: Bootstrap, datatables, fontawesome;
- Database: Microsoft SQL;
- Deadline: 4 weeks;
- *No previous knowledge of either C# or databases*

## Short Description
- This application is an improved variant of [my WinFormsApp School Management Project](https://github.com/mircea-negrau/High-School-Class-Management-Project), as all the elements shown in the application are programatically generated instead of being hard-coded;
- The database was set up so that multiple teachers could connect to the program remotely;
- The application aims to function as a school gradebook, the teacher having the opportunity to grade students and add or motivate their absences;
- Also, teachers can change details (add / delete grades / absences) only to the classrooms they teach and only to the subjects they teach to that subject (unless this is the assigned teacher of the class - thus having access to motivate absences to any student). 
- This version aims, moreover, to provide the opportunity for students (and their parents) to strictly access their own information (grades, absences, classroom);

## Features
### - Main Menu:
- The top right area changes according to whether or not the user is logged in;
- The navigation bar changes according to the options available to the user (different for student, teacher and guardian);
![Main Menu](/images/main_page.PNG)
- Guests have to login or apply for a registration.
- Pages cannot be accessed unless the minimum user status is met by the current user (guests cannot open grading pages, etc.);
- Users know they are signed in as the Login button is replaced by 'Welcome {user}';

### - Login System:
- A main login page, from which the user chooses what type of connection they want to establish (student, teacher, guardian);
![Main Page Login](/images/login_page.PNG)
- Each login page is independent from the others (students cannot connect from the teacher's login page);
- An error is prompted back if the credentials entered are not found in the users database;

### - Guest Actions
- Unless logged in, guests can only access the following pages (merged into one photo, but separate as webpages), which log them accordingly:

- If guest has no account yet, but they are a student of the institution, they can apply for an account registration, which gets manually verified by a secretary to be accepted.

### - Student Actions
![Student Information](/images/student_information.PNG)
- The student is able to see all the details stored by the application: student information, grades, absences and overall situation (unimplemented);
- The data table, possible subject droplist choices and name of the teacher are all programatically generated by the application using the data found in the database;
- The student is only able to see his own situation;
- This is the exact same page the student's guardian sees;

### - Teacher Actions
![Main Page Teachers](/images/teacher_main_page.PNG)
- If an user is logged in as a teacher, the navigation bar changes accordingly and allows them to enter the 'Classroom';
- 'High School' is the only 'Classroom' option that is implemented;

![List Classes](/images/classes_list.PNG)
- The application programatically generates the list of existing classes;
- Each line is highlighted in blue when hovered over and points towards the classroom's students list (classroom students list to be implemented);
- Teachers would be able to enter the class' student management only if they teach a course to that specific class;

![Manage Student](/images/manage_student.PNG)
- The page opens after a student is selected from the (unimplemented) classroom list of students and displays its details;
- The user must be a teacher account having a teaching the respective classroom;
- The teacher is able to read-only the student's details;
- The teacher is able to see, update and give a grade, or mark as absent, the student (unimplemented);


### - SQL Database
![Databases](/images/database.PNG)
